# ðŸ§¼ Clean Neovim Config ðŸ§¼

This is my neovim lua config which is full of custom keymaps, some heat ðŸ”¥
custom functions, and custom configurations for plugins.

Comes with three themes and two completion sources to choose between.

Some of the plugins with configs:
* chadtree
* coq_nvim
* indent-blankline.nvim
* lspconfig
* lualine
* null-ls
* nvim-cmp
* nvim-dap
* nvim-treesitter
* telescope

## Installation

Stow is required to install the config.

For Ubuntu:
```bash
sudo apt install stow
```

```bash
git clone https://github.com/declancm/nvim-lua.git
stow nvim-lua
```
